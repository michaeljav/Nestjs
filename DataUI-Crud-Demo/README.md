Discover the DataUI CRUD library's ease and power through this demo project. Effortlessly create CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for your REST API. Integrated with PostgreSQL and Swagger, this project also showcases the documentation capabilities of Swagger, providing clear endpoint details and schemas. Additionally, a resource's endpoints were created using the standard approach in combination with the NestJS-paginate library as a contrast to the DataUI CRUD library's generation properties. This way all differences as well as all pros and cons to each approach are showcased on a practical example.

To start the project simply run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run start:dev
```
